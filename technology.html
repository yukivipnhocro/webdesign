                         <dd>Blockchain has started to be applied in the financial industry and has expanded to government, healthcare, manufacturing, supply chains and other areas. Blockchain is able to reduce costs, reduce transaction time and improve cash flow. The pure blockchain models are not yet developed and can be quite difficult to scale. However, businesses should begin to review and evaluate this technology from now on.

                         <dd>Smart things use AI and learn machines to interact in a smarter way with people and surroundings. These things work automatically or semi-automatically to complete a specific task. You can explore capacity options that automatically guide AI in any object in the organization or customer work environment but these devices are best used for purposes with a gender scope. Because these devices cannot have the same capacity as the human brain to make decisions.
